        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I remember making sugar cookies as a kid. I loved rolling out the dough and finding fun cookie cutter shapes to use.</p>
        <p>This recipe comes from <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/10402/the-best-rolled-sugar-cookies/">J Saunders on AllRecipes</a>.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
            <li>4 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>5 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Beat sugar and softened butter together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until smooth.</li>
            <li>Beat in eggs and vanilla. Stir in flour, baking powder, and salt. Cover, and chill dough for at least 1 hour (or overnight).</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly dust a work surface with flour. Roll out dough to 1/4 to 1/2 inch thickness.</li>
            <li>Cut into shapes with any cookie cutter. Place cookies 1 inch apart on ungreased baking sheets.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cookies are lightly browned, 6 to 8 minutes. Carefully transfer cookies to a wire rack and cool completely before decorating.</li>
